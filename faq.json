  "aboutme": "Hi, I'm a Matrix bot for quickly answering questions in the Techlore room. You can see the available entries by entering `!faq index`. You can look up a question by entering `!faq foo`, where `foo` is the name of the entry. I was made by fireTwoOneNine and others, and hosted by FantasyCookie17; my source code is available at https://codeberg.org/FantasyCookie17/techlore-faq-bot (MIT/X11 license). What I say represents consensus in the room; if you disagree, please send a pull request. If you like me, star my repository!",
  "whynotencrypted": "As this room is publicly accessible, anybody who wants to join the room to read its messages is allowed to. Matrix uses transport layer encryption via TLS (HTTPS) however, so your messages are not sent in clear text; they're only readable on the participating servers. As we bridge this room with our Discord server and the bridge bot, as well as some Matrix clients, don't support e2ee, we have chosen not to activate it at the moment.",
  "whydiscord": "We bridge this room to Discord in order to reach the masses. A lot of people who are new to privacy and security don't use Matrix yet, but we would like to help as many people as possible and also introduce them to Matrix in return! We are aware of privacy concerns, but keep in mind this room is publicly accessible by anyone either way.",
  "thisroom": "This chat is a Matrix room, discussing privacy, security and anonymity. We're a place for the community of the Techlore channel to gather and talk to others interested in the aforementioned topics. You can find the Techlore channel on YouTube, PeerTube and LBRY.",
  "slow": "As a tremendous amount of people use the matrix.org homeserver, it is often overloaded and sometimes slow to respond. You can fix this by switching to another homeserver! Good alternatives include privacytools.io, feneas.org, weho.st, pine64.org, kde.org, nitro.chat, halogen.city, oper.io and gnuradio.org, or even running your own! Note that at time of writing, this requires re-registering with another account at that server, as nomadic identities haven't been implemented yet.",
  "serverorroom": "Chats in Matrix are called rooms, and can have multiple participating servers due to federation. Discord uses the term server in a misleading way.",
  "bots": "We have a Discord bridge (public instance of t2bot.io), Mjolnir to help with moderation (hosted by @kuhaku:nop.zone) and this FAQ bot (hosted by @fantasycookie17:fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com). If you have other bots that might be useful for this room, please contact the mods.",
  "phones": "Linux-based smartphones provide flexibility for users of desktop Linux distributions. They may also have the least telemetry of the default operating systems on consumer phones, however, they are currently at a very experimental and unpolished stage and need support. The Pinephone is the preferred option over the Librem 5 because it is more reasonably priced and makes firmware available to the user. If security and privacy from apps is the primary focus, the best options are a supported iPhone (with iCloud disabled) or a Pixel phone running GrapheneOS. Most Android phones come with variations of AOSP that weaken security with substandard implementations or threaten security and privacy with unneeded bloatware. It is preferable to aim for a manufacturer that provides an OS closer to stock, meaning minimal deviation from stock Android (AOSP).",
  "chromiumvsfirefox": "Firefox currently lacks site isolation (outside of Nightly) and CFI, but has Tab Containers (which are a privacy, not a security feature). Also it has some more configurability, especially when utilizing `about:config`. Telemetry for both can be disabled, but by default, Chromium has less. Iridium and Ungoogled-Chromium send very little to no telemetry data by default. For the Tor anonymity network, the Tor Browser should be preferred nevertheless, if you want to be anonymous.",
  "desktopos": "Windows 10 in the non-Enterprise/Education editions should be avoided at all cost if you care about privacy. However, most Linux desktop distros do not focus on security. Whonix and CLIP OS try to fix some of these issues, as well as Qubes OS (which is not really a Linux distro however). For the future, Genode and RedoxOS may be worth considering as well, for example. For security, don't use 'stable' (point release) distros like Debian or Ubuntu, as they freeze packages and only patch CVEs, which means a lot of issues stay unfixed. Instead, for security, rolling or semi-rolling release distributions should be preferred. For more information, see https://fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com/posts/2020/08/a-secure-os.html, and perhaps join #os-security:fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com.",
  "extensions": "Check out uBlock Origin (uBO), LocalCDN, Privacy Redirect and HTTPS Everywhere.",
  "areyouabot": "Well, I am, however the other users in this room are not, as it is actually a Matrix room and only bridged to Discord. The bridged Matrix users will just appear to be bots on the Discord side.",
  "isitsafe": "'Is XYZ safe?' is a question that we see a lot and that is actually quite difficult to answer without more information about you and your use case.\nShort answer: No, (almost) nothing is 100% safe.\nLong answer: It depends. ;-) No highly complex system/software is completely safe as evident by the huge amount of bugs discovered every day.\nIt also depends a lot on your personal use case, your threat model, your OPSEC practices and many other variables.\nExample: While the Signal Messenger is considered to be secure this won't help you at all if there's a malicious keylogger active on your system."
