  "aboutme": "Hi, I'm a Matrix bot for quickly answering questions in the Techlore room. You can see the available entries by entering `!faq index`. You can look up a question by entering `!faq foo`, where `foo` is the name of the entry. I was made by fireTwoOneNine and others, and hosted by FantasyCookie17; my source code is available at https://codeberg.org/FantasyCookie17/techlore-faq-bot (MIT/X11 license). What I say recommends consensus in the room; if you disagree, please send a pull request. If you like me, star my repository!",
  "whynotencrypted": "As this room is publicly accessible, anybody who wants to join the room to read its messages is allowed to. Matrix uses transport layer encryption via TLS (HTTPS) however, so your messages are not sent in clear text; they're only readable on the participating servers. As we bridge this room with our Discord server and the bridge bot, as well as some Matrix clients, don't support e2ee, we have chosen not to activate it at the moment.",
  "whydiscord": "We bridge this room to Discord in order to reach the masses. A lot of people who are new to privacy and security don't use Matrix yet, but we would like to help as many people as possible and also introduce them to Matrix in return! We are aware of privacy concerns, but keep in mind this room is publicly accessible by anyone either way.",
  "thisroom": "This chat is a Matrix room, discussing privacy, security and anonymity. We're a place for the community of the Techlore channel to gather and talk to others interested in the aforementioned topics. You can find the Techlore channel on YouTube, PeerTube and LBRY.",
  "slow": "As a tremendous amount of people use the matrix.org homeserver, it is often overloaded and sometimes slow to respond. You can fix this by switching to another homeserver! Good alternatives include privacytools.io, feneas.org, weho.st, pine64.org, kde.org, nitro.chat, halogen.city and chatserver.ca, or even running your own! Note that at time of writing, this requires re-registering with another account at that server, as nomadic identities haven't been implemented yet.",
  "serverorroom": "See the explanations for \"homeserver\" and \"room\" at https://github.com/MilkManzJourDaddy/matrix-org/wiki/Glossary-of-Terms-in-Matrix",
  "bots": "We have a Discord bridge (public instance of t2bot.io), Mjolnir to help with moderation (hosted by @kuhaku:nop.zone) and this FAQ bot (hosted by @fantasycookie17:fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com). If you have other bots that might be useful for this room, please contact the mods.",
  "phones": "While Linux phones like the Librem 5 or Pinephone don't have any telemetry, the main reason you'll want one of them is not security, for which an iPhone or Android phone (particularly one with GrapheneOS or CalyxOS) would be better, but flexibility. The Pinephone should typically be preferred over the Librem 5, as it's less overpriced and doesn't lock firmware away from the user.",
  "chromiumvsfirefox": "Firefox currently lacks site isolation (outside of Nightly) and CFI, but has Tab Containers (which are a privacy, not a security feature). Also it has some more configurability, especially when utilizing `about:config`. Telemetry for both can be disabled, but by default, Chromium has less. Iridium and Ungoogled-Chromium send very little to no telemetry data by default. For the Tor anonymity network, the Tor Browser should be preferred nevertheless, if you want to be anonymous.",
  "desktopos": "Windows should be avoided at all cost if you care about privacy. However, most Linux desktop distros do not focus on security. Whonix and CLIP OS try to fix some of these issues, as well as Qubes OS (which is not really a Linux distro however). For the future, Genode and RedoxOS may be worth considering as well, for example. For security, don't use 'stable' (point release) distros like Debian or Ubuntu, as they freeze packages and only patch CVEs, which means a lot of issues stay unfixed. Instead, for security, rolling or semi-rolling release distributions like Fedora, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, Arch Linux, Gentoo, Void Linux or Solus should be preferred. For more information, see https://fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com/posts/2020/08/a-secure-os.html, and perhaps join #os-security:fantasycookie17.onederfultech.com .",
  "extensions": "Check out uMatrix (read its wiki), uBlock Origin (uBO), Privacy Possum, Decentraleyes/LocalCDN, Privacy Redirect, CSS Exfil Protection and HTTPS Everywhere. If you're on Chromium, it may be wise to use uBlock Origin Extra along with uBO.",
  "areyouabot": "No. This is actually a Matrix room and only bridged to Discord, however, the bridged Matrix users will appear to be bots on the Discord side."
